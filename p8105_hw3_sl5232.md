## Problem 1

Load Data from p8015 dataset.

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

``` r
aisle_df = instacart %>%
  count(aisle, name = "n_orders") %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_orders))
```

There are 134 distinct aisles, and the top five aisles from which most
items are ordered from arefresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged
vegetables fruits, yogurt, and packaged cheese.

``` r
aisle_df %>% 
  filter(n_orders > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n_orders)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n_orders)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items for each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

The above code chunk makes a plot that shows the number of items ordered
in each aisle that has more than 10000 items ordered.Aisles are arranged
in a low to high fashion according to the number of items ordered.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

The above code chunk shows the three most popular items and their
ordered times in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food
care”, “packaged vegetables fruits”.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

The above code chunk shows the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week.

## Problem 2

First,load and clean the dataset

``` r
accel_df = read.csv("data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "activity_number",
    values_to = "activity_counts"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(day_type = ifelse(day == ("Sunday") | day == ("Saturday"), "weekends", "weekdays")) %>% 
  select(week, day_id, day, day_type, everything()) 
```

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  group_by(day_id, day, day_type) %>% 
  summarize(daily_counts = sum(activity_counts)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'day_id', 'day'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| day_id | day       | day_type | daily_counts |
